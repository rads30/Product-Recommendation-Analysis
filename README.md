# Product-Recommendation-Analysis
This project identifies products that are frequently purchased together to create a mini recommendation engine for e-commerce platforms. It demonstrates skills in SQL, Python, data visualization, and Tableau dashboards, simulating real-world analytics used in retail.


# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to help businesses:
Recommend products that customers are likely to buy together
Optimize cross-selling and product bundling
Increase average order value and revenue
Provide actionable insights using interactive dashboards
I used a synthetic co-purchase dataset to simulate real e-commerce data.

| Column              | Description                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Product_A           | Primary product purchased                              |
| Recommended_Product | Product purchased along with Product_A                 |
| Co_Purchase_Count   | Number of times these products were purchased together |
